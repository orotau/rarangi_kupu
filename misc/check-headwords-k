We have retrieved the html files from the web

1) At the most coarse the 'headword' we used is simply
wrong. In this case we need to 

a) Change the entry in the LibreOffice spreadsheet ctrl-H to find in the spreadsheet
b) Delete the html file from the filesystem
c) Rerun the pull_to_the_filesystem
d) Check we have the correct number of files
