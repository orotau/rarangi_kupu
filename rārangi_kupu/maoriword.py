'''
This module contains a class and some functions
I wasn't sure whether to put the function inside the class
or not.
I got very confused and so ended up putting the functions outside
the class.
I started them with an underscore but don't know if that was the
'right' thing to do. Some idea of 'only to be used internally'
There is considerable testing for this module made using
pytest which was

a) Easy to use
b) Helped me to see that I need to rearrange my code because
it was hard to test.

I am at the point now 1 August 2015 where I can safely give
the sorting information to the Unicode people.
