'''
The purpose of this module is to tie entries / sub-entries
to the tauria given.

For example
"kōkopu ruwao" is a sub-entry and the example is
" . . . aku kōkopu rūwao kua riro atu nei i te iwi."

There is a difference "ruwao" vs "rūwao"
It could be a mistake but to stop me questioning Te Haumihiata
all the time, I will search for "kōkopu rūwao" as well as "kōkopu ruwao"
and amalgamate the results
