How to establish if a word is only capitalised because it is the start of a sentence?

How to establish if a word would have been capitalised anyway, even if it wasn't at the start of a sentence?

Why do you need to know this?

a) Fear that I may falsely identify 'open compounds' and/or 'single capitalised words' based on the capitalised nature of the first word in sentence. 

b)  Want to lump together words that are only capitalised because they are the first word of a sentence and their uncapitalised equivalents.

The odd sentence starts with 'Te' or 'Ngā' they look like they should be left alone


What indicates the start of a sentence?
