We will need to work out what to do about these

They may actually exist but as twigs (more investigation required)

The things that are clear
There is a root
There is a trunk
There is a twig

The things that are not clear
If the trunk word form can exist by itself

For example
kōpūtahi
This entry appears confused at best. 
It would definitely suggest that the trunk word can exist by itself
because that is exactly how it is used in the given example.

kārangaranga
This example suggests that the trunk word cannot exist by itself!
This is consistent with all the other examples

Problems that need to be solved
How to model this situation
How to allow the creation of a word list

Proposed solution
Model
Model each example by setting branch = 0 and twig = 1
